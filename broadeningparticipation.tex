Recall that we aim for the same with our \emph{network scripting} libraries: open-source software that aspiring operators in rural areas in developing countries can use both to learn NDA techniques and to use in the field.

Operators of rural networks, because they are called upon to do many tasks, are likely to find useful more familiar programming paradigms, rather than sophisticated specification languages~\cite{netkat,propane}.  We aim to provide these operators with the ability to easily produce \emph{network scripts} that automate common tasks.  Recall that 
we will couple network scripting with a \emph{simulator} that can be used by rural operators to test the impact of scripting commands on models of real networks, including their own. This can serve both as an educational tool and to help assess impact of configuration changes pre-deployment.

Once we have this in place:

Helping reach underprepresented minorities and woman to be network operators even in the US.  (Barath please add) While this is too lofty a goal, we want to do a test run to teach kids in downtown LA via a workshop in the second and fourth years.

Barath add details?
