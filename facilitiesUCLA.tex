Profs.\ Varghese, Millstein, Netravali and Tamir are members of UCLA's
Computer Science Department.  Their offices are just down the hall from one another.  Varghese and Millstein share a lab for their students, and Tamir and Netravali's students are in a nearby lab.  Each lab has
approximately 700 square feet of space and
includes desk space and state-of-the-art workstations for each
student.
All workstations are
connected to the Computer Science Department's local area network (LAN),
which in turn connects to UCLA's main network and from there to the broader Internet. 

The PIs also have several high-end computers in the
department's machine room, which function as compute servers and as
repositories for their research infrastructure.


In addition to its major
networking function, the department computing facility also provides many
computing resources, including disk storage and backup, general-purpose timesharing access to multi-user systems, email, and more than 600 workstations for research
and educational usage.
