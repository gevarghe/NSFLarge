The preceding section presented abstractions to address network design challenges. The utility of these abstractions depends upon methodologies to map between abstraction levels, as in EDA. Some mapping tasks are relatively straightforward, while others are risky, potentially transformative, and require new science. While the directions are necessarily diverse to address different stakeholders, they are united by common themes: {\em based on algorithmic search}, {\em interdisciplinary} (using multiple skill sets enabled by an NSF Large), and {\em domain-specific} (addressing the complexities but exploiting the structure of networks).
