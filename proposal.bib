% Whippersnapper is a set of benchmarks for P4. Rather than simply selecting a set of representative data-plane programs, the benchmark is designed from first principles, identifying and exploring key features and metrics.  Whippersnapper identifies and evaluates a number of networking and P4 primitives such as latency and throughput, but also metrics for processing packets such as parsing, state access, packet modification, and match action complexity.  The benchmark provides a vehicle for comparing implementations and designs.

%P4FPGA is a new tool for developing and evaluating data plane applications. P4FPGA is an open-source compiler and runtime. The compiler extends the P4.org reference compiler with a custom backend that generates FPGA code. P4FPGA supports both a bump-in-the-wire and multi-port switching architectures, allowing users to select the best architecture for their particular application.
%P4FPGA generates designs that can be synthesized to either Xilinx or Altera FPGAs. We have benchmarked several representative P4 programs, and the experiments show that code generated by P4FPGA runs at line-rate at all packet sizes with latencies comparable to commercial ASICs. By combining high-level programming abstractions offered by P4 with a flexible and powerful hardware target, P4FPGA allows developers to rapidly prototype and deploy new data plane applications.

% minProbe measures and estimates available bandwidth with high-fidelity, minimal-cost, and in userspace; thus, enabling cheaper (virtually no overhead) and more accurate available bandwidth estimation. MinProbe performs accurately on high capacity networks up to 10 Gbps and with bursty cross traffic. We evaluated the performance and accuracy of minProbe over a wide-area network, the National Lambda Rail (NLR), and within our own network testbed. Results indicate that minProbe can estimate available bandwidth with error typically no more than 0.4 Gbps in a 10 Gbps network.

% SoNIC, Software-deﬁned Network Interface Card, which provides access to the physical and data link layers in software by implementing them in software. In other words, by implementing the creation of the physical layer bitstream in software and the transmission of this bitstream in hardware, SoNIC provides complete control over the entire network stack in realtime. SoNIC utilizes commodity off-the-shelf multi-core processors to implement parts of the physical layer in software, and employs an FPGA board to transmit optical signal over the wire. Our evaluations demonstrate that SoNIC can communicate with other network components while providing realtime access to the entire network stack in software. As an example of SoNIC’s ﬁne-granularity control, it can perform precise network measurements, accurately characterizing network components such as routers, switches, and network interface cards. Further, SoNIC enables timing channels with nanosecond modulations that are undetectable in software.

for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.}
