\section{Broader Impacts}

This projects will have a number of positive impacts on society: 1. Public Clouds: We will partner with leading technology companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Huawei, and VMware) to develop, deploy, and evaluate NDA technology, with the goal of making them more efficient and reliable. 2. Operator Outreach: We will build a network scripting language and simulation tools for rural ISP operators (Grameen, Motech) and will work with them to improve the reliability and efficiency of their networks. We will also release training materials and tools online to reach operators in developing countries. 3. Technology Transfer: We will contribute to existing industrial efforts such as the P4 language and will also initiate new efforts to enhance the hardware primitives provided by router vendors especially for debugging. Varghese has a longstanding relationship with Cisco. 4. Education and Students: We will create a sustaining community of students who will drive the field forward via new courses that capture the key ideas behind Network Design Automation in a form that can be used and extended by the community. 6. Community Building: We will organize an annual meeting for industry and PhD students in NDA
